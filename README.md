# map-game

Concept text based game where you move between rooms in generated maps. Find the portal and go through it to generate and proceed to the next map. Not much to do yet.

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.10
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) >= 1.2

If you don't want to use poetry just make sure you have [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) and [`textual`](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) installed.

### Usage

`poetry run python mapgame/mapgame.py`

I can't get it to work inside VS Code's integrated terminal on Windows (but it works fine on macos); you may have to use an external terminal.
