Player Attributes

- Strength (attack power)
- Toughness (max hp)
- Luck (modifier)


TO DO
- Randomize portal position
- Add enemies/combat
- Add chests you can open
    - generate consumables
    - mimics after a certain level
- consumable items
- inventory

- write a script for non-combat NPC encounters


BIG PICTURE
- Find end of floor portal to exit to "hub world"
- Choose a floor class (E-A) and difficulty (1-9) - beat last level to unlock next, beat all to unlock next class
- Long term resource: Humanity - If it hits 0 it's gg, v valuable
- Perhaps portal restores humanity sometimes?
    - perhaps this is the reward for clearing a cell not previously cleared
- On each floor:
    - Clear a floor of enemies for a special reward (?)
    - Enemies walk around and can get stronger over time (they find chests?)
    - Fight enemies and lose HP
    - Regen HP in portal and with consumables
    - Most consumables reduce humanity at least by a small amount, some increase it
    - HP to zero sends you back to the hub world; lose lots of humanity
- Find adventurers to recruit
    - Arm them with nice gear and they'll pay dividends




I like the idea that the NPCs are running around gobbling up stuff and they'll buff themselves if you don't get there in time

inventory is a list you rm from? or perhaps a class so you can check weight before adding items, etc
